# SICalc
Engineering calculator that works with [SI metric unit prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix) such as Giga(G), Mega(M) ... Mili(m), Micro(u), Nano(n), Pico(p)

# UI

You can easily calculate for example a cutoff frequency of a low pass filter:

# Constants

Calculator knows constants:
* pi as reasonably precise
* e as 2.7

# Prefixes

The unique feature is that you can enter 1000 as 1k and so on. 

The known prefixes are: 
* Giga(G)
* Mega(M)
* Kilo(k)
* Mili(m)
* Micro(u)
* Nano(n)
* Pico(p)

# LabVIEW

Software is programmed in LabVIEW 2013. Source code and built exe file is available in this repository.

# Contribution

I welcome any contribution to this project to make it even better.
